## Stuff that could be refined
- Right now the compare functions has all the path's<br>
for files & folders that need to be deleted, then <br>
they are deleted folders first files second which <br>
results in some console errors to pop up (doesn't <br>
affect the program).<br>
<br>
- There's also an instance where because of a single<br>
wrong file the entire replica subdirectory is deleted<br>
again (doesn't affect the program).<br>
